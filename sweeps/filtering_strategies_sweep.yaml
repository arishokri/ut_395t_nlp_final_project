# Sweep configuration for filtering strategies
# Experiments with cartography filtering and cluster filtering on training set
# (cluster filtering does not filter validation set to avoid cluster mismatch)

# Metric to optimize
# Using F1 instead of exact_match because:
# - F1 is more lenient and rewards partial matches, providing better training signal
# - Exact match is very strict (single char difference = wrong), can be noisy for model selection
# - F1 correlates well with EM; both metrics are logged to W&B for comparison
