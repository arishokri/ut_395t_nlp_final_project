She was diuresed six liters and a right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 40/15, wedge of 12, and cardiac output of 5.2.

She was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with clindamycin, which caused resolution of her white count. She was also given Solu-Medrol 40 mg intravenous q.6 hours for possible asthma, and had an increase in her Lasix and lisinopril dose, as well as her amiodarone.

Mrs. Wetterauer was admitted to the Aley Coness-o Meoak Medical Center for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation controlled with amiodarone, and had an increase in her Lasix and lisinopril dose, as well as her amiodarone. She was also given Solu-Medrol 40 mg intravenous q.6 hours for possible asthma. For her anxiety, the patient was treated acutely with Ativan and her problem resolved quite well, and she became more comfortable in the hospital.
